“Rose, its not what it looks like, you see Mira here told me to
check one of her undergarments because she suspects an insect
was there”. These were the words that kept replaying in Rose’s
mind. ‘How stupid does john think I am, that lie did not even
make sense how could he be checking for insects in her bra. John
always with his stupid lies and flirting, why are men so…’. Rose
had been crying for a long time now and her father was beginning
to worry that she would have no tears left to mourn him when he
dies while her mother and sisters were tired of trying to clog a
fountain and so they decided to leave her alone for sometime to
comport her emotions, it seemed like it was only the Persian cat
that was succeeding in consoling her.
